An application to build my own film library, which I created during the *JavaScript Apps Starter* course organized by the **Girls Code Fun Foundation**. I plan to add a login. - [on-line view](https://kasiaizak.github.io/filmleb/)

## Technologies used

HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 4 is responsible for the visual version) and JavaScript (jQuery library). To manage the data base was used Firebase (permanently locked to the public, temporarily lock can be removed to add new data).
